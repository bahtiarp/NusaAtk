ATK Framework is a special purpose PHP framework targeted at business applications.

It's targeted at developers who wish to focus on business logic, instead of coding HTML. Where other application frameworks mainly provide a large set of utility classes, ATK provides a complete framework that requires only small amounts of code to get usable applications, while maintaining full flexibility.

ATK was originally developed by Ivo Jansch and iBuildings back in 2000. It's been actively developed until 2011 (version 6.6).
This repo is managed by NusaAtk. We still have some active projects based on various versions of ATK. Since we didn't find a true alternative to ATK yet, we opted to keep it alive.
